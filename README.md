Aim: To studyand implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Algorithm: 
1. Start the program.
2. Declare an integer variable. Prompt the user and read an integer. Print its value and size.
3. Declare a float variable. Prompt the user and read a float. Print its value and size.
4. Declare a string variable. Prompt the user and read a word. Print its value and size.
5. Declare a double variable. Prompt the user and read a double. Print its value and size.
6. Declare a char variable. Prompt the user and read a character. Print its value and size.
7. Declare a bool variable. Prompt the user and read a boolean value (true/false). Print its value and size.
8. End the program.

Theory: 
- This C++ program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
- It uses 'cin' to receive the inputs and saves them in 'num1' and 'num2'.
- Then, it calculates the sum by adding these two numbers and saves the result in the variable 'sum'.
- Finally, it shows the sum using 'cout'.
- This program illustrates basic input, output, and arithmetic operations in C++.

Conclusion: The program demonstrates how to take input and show the value and size of different data types in C++. It provides a clear understanding of memory usage for each type.
