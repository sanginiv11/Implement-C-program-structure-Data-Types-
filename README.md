Aim: To studyand implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

Theory: This C++ program prompts the user to enter two numbers. It uses 'cin' to receive the inputs and saves them in 'num1' and 'num2'. Then, it calculates the sum by adding these two numbers and saves the result in the variable 'sum'. Finally, it shows the sum using 'cout'. This program illustrates basic input, output, and arithmetic operations in C++.

Conclusion: The program demonstrates how to take input and show the value and size of different data types in C++. It provides a clear understanding of memory usage for each type.
